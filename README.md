# Overview
For this project, my goal was to learn how to make a webapp in a language I haven't used before over the space of two weeks for at least 10 hours. I decided to make a portfolio website using React. 

To start the program, open a terminal and go to the directory the project is saved in. From there, type 'npm start' to run the project in a blank tab on your local computer. The page should be up and running.

My purpose for writing this software was to gain additional experience and exposure in programming in language I haven't used yet.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages
For now, I have two pages created on my portfolio--the home page and coding projects page. The home page is a simple welcome page to my website, and the coding projects page is a place for me to showcase various projects that I've worked on over the years. The nav bar has been dynamically created along with some global css. Having the nav bar be dynamically created has made things super helpful because I can go into that one file and change things that I need to and the navbar will automatically updated on every page, which decreases the time that would be used to update it manually on every page. 

# Development Environment
To develop the software, I used VS code as my platform to write my code, and I used React for the programming language. 

The programming language that I used was React. React is a webapp programming language which uses mainly Java Script and CSS to create web apps. These webapp sites can also be viewed on mobile devices.
